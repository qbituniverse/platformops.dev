# Introduction

Software is no longer delivered in isolation. The days of a manual compile, build, package and deploy are long gone. This shift from manual to automated processes has brought new practices in the world of software development and delivery, mainly around the following 5 points:

1. How software is written?
    - Software Component: Any language and platform agnostic mindset, Windows, Linux or Mac
    - Software Architecture: Monolith versus Microservice
2. How software projects are structured?
    - Frameworks: Maven, Dotnet, Angular
    - Declarative Artefacts: YAML or JSON declarations
    - Imperative Artefacts: Bash or Powershell scripts
3. How software is packaged and delivered?
    - Platform Agnostic: Containers, Docker Images
    - Cloud Agnostic: Terraform Templates
    - DevOps Automation: Azure Devops, Jenkins, Chef
4. How software is consumed?
    - Mobile and Tablet: Online versus Offline
    - Desktop: Windows, Linux or Mac
    - IoT: Edge and wearables
5. How and where software is running?
    - Infrastructure: "... as Code" mindset, deploy - destroy - deploy again...
    - Networking and Access: Intranet, Internet and Edge access

In essence, the 5 points above define how important **PlatformOps** role is in todayâ€™s world. The role of **platformops.dev** is to help you learn how to put together simple as well as complex software architectures and deliver these in "one-click", or "as code" fashion - reliably, any time of the day.
